# Phase 3: Court-Ready Compliance & Reporting
**Component:** Vigil Legal & Administrative Dashboard
**Milestone:** Defensible Compliance Documentation

## 1. Data Integrity (Chain of Custody)
To ensure reports are "Court-Ready," Vigil implements a cryptographic audit trail:
* **Immutable Logs:** Every alcohol detection event and biometric status change is time-stamped and hashed.
* **Tamper-Evident PDFs:** Exported reports include a digital signature to prove the data has not been altered since the event.

## 2. The "R/Y/G" Compliance Metric
We replace raw, confusing medical charts with simple, defensible status indicators:
* **Green (Compliant):** All biometric baselines within normal range; no alcohol detected.
* **Yellow (Caution):** Deviation in stress (GSR) or activity patterns; requires case manager review.
* **Red (Non-Compliant):** Confirmed transdermal alcohol detection or unauthorized device removal.

## 3. Automated Export Features
Phase 3 introduces one-click reporting tailored for:
* **Parole/Probation Officers:** Summary of compliance over the last 30 days.
* **Rehab Facilities:** Real-time biometric trends to support continued care authorization for insurance.
* **Legal Counsel:** Verified incident timelines with objective biometric backing.
